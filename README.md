after you download the main file, there are still a few things to do
1.create a folder and put the file into the folder
2.create six .txt files using the following name:
all, connection, point_addition, setup, graphic_X, graphic_Y
3.open all.txt and input the path of the rest 5 .txt files
4.input the parametres to the .txt files
5.now you can run the program, type 'all.txt' and press Enter
6.if you see it drawing, it works properly

here is the explaination of the different .txt files
point_addition is for adding points
the first number is the number of points, then cordinate XYZ of the point
connection is for lines
the first number is the number of lines, then pointA and B of the line
setup is for some other parametres
from left to right:
cordinate XYZ of viewer,horizenal and perpendicular directions focus distance and multiply
*multiply is for zooming the images, usually 50
*when the focus distance is high, you should increace multiply at the same time
*focus distance is usually arround 1.5, the image will look strange when it is too high
